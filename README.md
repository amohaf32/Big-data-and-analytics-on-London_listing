## Introduction
This repository is designed to support coursework and projects in the field of big data and predictive analysis. It includes datasets, scripts, and documentation to help you explore and implement predictive models using large-scale data.
This mini project work was done as part of learning curve for Big Data and Predictive analysis. 

## Prerequisites
Before using this repository, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
- A working knowledge of data analysis and machine learning concepts

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/big-data-predictive-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd big-data-predictive-analysis
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
- Add your datasets to the `data/` directory.
- Use the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the `notebooks/` and `scripts/` directories to analyze data and build predictive models.
- Refer to the documentation in the `docs/` folder for detailed instructions.
